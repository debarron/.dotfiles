# nvim-vimscript
This repo configures neovim using vimscript.
But, no need to worry I will also include something in lua.

Make sure to install neovim, I recommend using [this](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim)
tutorial, it will definetly help.

## How to install this config
1. Run `cp .config/nvim ~/.config`
2. Open nvim and run `:PluginInstall`
3. Close nvim and ... Damn! Open it back again
