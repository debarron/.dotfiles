My dev configuration. Let's do this one more time.
- neovim
- zsh

## Before we start
I assume `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` exists and it points to `~/.config` directory. Here is where all the configs go

## neovim
Run `scripts/install_nvim.sh NVIM_LINK_DIR`. `NVIM_LINK_DIR` is where to put the relative symlink to the nvim executable. 
Ex. 
```
./scripts/install_nvim.sh ~/bin
```
